     * PRO TIP: this is good when trying to dynamically change from a
     * dark to a light theme or vice versa using ANSI escape sequences.
     *
     * Scenario:
     *
     * If on a dark theme we set defaultbg = 0 (with 15 being the
     * defaultfg), then changing the value of '0' to what would be
     * appropriate for a light theme (e.g. #ffffff) would turn the
     * background white, when what we really wanted was to alter the
     * foreground.
     * That is because the assumption for the design of the Tempus
     * themes is that colour codes represent colours.  So if a light
     * theme needs a black foregound, it must use color0.  Whereas
     * others default to defining the value of color0 as equivalent to
     * background regardless of the colour value (and color15 as the
     * foreground in the same way).  I think this is semantically
     * incorrect and might cause problems.
     *
     * For working examples, see my dotfiles, specifically the
     *  under the "bin" directory:
     * https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.  Note that this script
     * is invoked from the ERROR At least 1 argument expected

EXAMPLE using Tempus Winter
own_script_update_environment_theme winter

For available arguments run:
