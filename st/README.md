# Tempus Themes for st (simple terminal)

Unlike other ports of the [Tempus themes collection](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/tempus-themes), this repo does not provide detailed instructions on how to use these themes.

The two assumptions underpinning that approach are as follows:

1. `st` is compiled by the user, meaning that there will not necessarily be a standard build to write instructions for.
2. Users of `st` are incorporating this program in their own custom workflow, and are, as such, more than able to replace their current colour specifications with new ones.

This is not meant to dissuade you. Feel free to open an issue if you still need help.
