## Project overview

*Tempus* is a collection of themes for Vim, text editors, and terminal emulators that are compliant *at the very least* with the WCAG AA accessibility standard for colour contrast (which stands for a minimum contrast ratio of 4.50:1â€”while some items have a 7.00:1 rating, or else WCAG AAA).

Colour schemes range from subdued and slightly desaturated, to vibrant and highly saturated. Each item in the Tempus collection consists of a 16-colour palette that corresponds to the basic values provided by all modern terminal emulators, namely: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, bright black, bright red, bright green, bright yellow, bright blue, bright magenta, bright cyan, bright white.

Themes come in either a light or a dark variant. This is to ensure colour contrast consistency.

Tempus themes are interoperable nonetheless. They are meant to work as a one-to-one replacement to each other, especially for items within the same contrast ratio boundary. This is due to their inherent colour qualities as well as their shared schema for mapping colours to objects of the code syntax. 

**IMPORTANT.** As this repo also contains screenshots, it is recommended you clone it with the `--depth 1` flag (shallow clone). Below is the syntax for cloning over ssh and https respectively:

```sh
# Shallow clone this repo (only latest commit)

## With ssh
git@gitlab.com:protesilaos/tempus-themes.git --depth 1

## With https
https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/tempus-themes.git --depth 1
```

## Applications

### How to use this repo

The Tempus project consists of a number of specialised repositories for each of the available ports. The current repo serves as the main hub, providing the overview of the project, and bundling all existing themes together.

Each directory herein contains files specific to the application it references. For example, the `urxvt` directory includes an `.Xresources` file for each item in the Tempus collection.

Instructions on how to use these files are documented in the `README.md` which is included in each directory. Exceptions are the `shell-variables`, `xcolors` and `yaml` directories, which include generic files.

- [pywal](https://gitlab.com/dylanaraps/pywal): `pywal` is a tool that generates a color palette from the dominant colors in an image. It also supports predefined themes and has over 250 themes built-in. You can also create your own theme files to share with others.
- [wpgtk](https://gitlab.com/deviantfero/wpgtk): `wpgtk` uses pywal as it's colorscheme generator, but builds upon it with a UI and other features, such as the abilty to mix and edit the colorschemes generated and save them with their respective wallpapers, having light and dark themes, hackable and fast GTK+ theme made specifically for `wpgtk` and custom keywords and values to replace in templates.
